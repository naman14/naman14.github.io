I have been working on this Music Player for a few months and now it has reached a stage where it can be released in Beta.
Timber is heavily focused on design but also have basic features for a Music player. Timber is currently a work in progress and I will be adding more features over the time. As always, Timber is fully open-source and absolutely free. Feel free to fork and send pull requests or create issues on Github if you have found some bugs.
